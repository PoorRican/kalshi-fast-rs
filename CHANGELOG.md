# Changelog

This file records release history for `kalshi-fast-rs`.

Release entries may include a `Compatibility` block summarizing the upstream
Kalshi docs snapshot tracked by that release.

For crate versioning policy and bump rules, see [`VERSIONING.md`](VERSIONING.md).


## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-01

### Compatibility

- Docs snapshot: 2026-06-01
- OpenAPI: 3.20.0
- AsyncAPI: 2.0.0
- Validated through changelog: 2026-06-04

### Added

- [Rust API] Added `is_block_trade: bool` to `Trade` (REST). Required by OpenAPI as of 2026-05-29.
  Uses `#[serde(default)]` so older payloads parse cleanly (defaults to `false`). The WebSocket
  `WsTrade` type is unchanged — `is_block_trade` does not appear in the AsyncAPI `tradePayload`.
- [Rust API] Added `is_block_trade: Option<bool>` to `GetTradesParams`. Applies to both
  `GET /markets/trades` and `GET /historical/trades`. `None` = all trades, `Some(true)` = block
  only, `Some(false)` = non-block only. Added to the OpenAPI spec on 2026-05-29.
- [Rust API] Added `FeeType::QuadraticWithMakerFees` variant. The spec documents this value
  (`quadratic_with_maker_fees`) since at least 2026-05-11 but the crate was missing it.
- [Rust API] Added V2 order endpoint types and methods:
  - `CreateOrderV2Request` / `CreateOrderV2Response` → `create_order_v2`
  - `CancelOrderV2Response` / `CancelOrderV2Params` → `cancel_order_v2`
  - `DecreaseOrderV2Request` / `DecreaseOrderV2Response` → `decrease_order_v2`
  - `AmendOrderV2Request` / `AmendOrderV2Response` → `amend_order_v2`
  - `BatchCreateOrdersV2Request` / `BatchCreateOrdersV2Response` → `batch_create_orders_v2`
  - `BatchCancelOrdersV2Request` / `BatchCancelOrdersV2Response` → `batch_cancel_orders_v2`
  - All map to `POST|DELETE /portfolio/events/orders*` endpoints in the OpenAPI spec.
- [Rust API] Surfaced `creator_subaccount: Option<u32>` on `RFQ` (was previously silently captured
  by the `extra` catch-all). Field visible when the caller is the RFQ creator.
- [Rust API] Surfaced `post_only: Option<bool>`, `creator_subaccount: Option<u32>`, and
  `rfq_creator_subaccount: Option<u32>` on `Quote`. Previously captured by `extra`.
- [Docs] Updated `docs/spec-parity.md` with notes for `is_block_trade`, `FeeType` variants,
  `fee_type_override` type change, and queue position field update.

### Changed

- [Rust API] `WsEventFeeUpdate.fee_type_override` changed from `Option<String>` to `Option<FeeType>`.
  Now that `FeeType::QuadraticWithMakerFees` covers all spec-documented values, using the typed enum
  is idiomatic. Unknown future values still deserialize as `FeeType::Unknown`, preserving losslessness.
  Same change applies to `WsEventFeeUpdateRef`.

### Breaking

- [Rust API] `OrderQueuePosition.queue_position` changed from `i64` to `Option<i64>`. The integer
  `queue_position` field is no longer required by the OpenAPI spec; only `queue_position_fp` is
  required. Downstream code reading `.queue_position` as an integer must unwrap or use the
  `.queue_position_fp` string field.
- [Rust API] `OrderQueuePosition.queue_position_fp` changed from `Option<FixedPointCount>` to
  `FixedPointCount`. The field is now required by the spec. Downstream code that was calling
  `.unwrap()` or `.as_deref()` must update to use the field directly.
- [Rust API] Same `queue_position` and `queue_position_fp` changes apply to
  `GetOrderQueuePositionResponse`.
- [Rust API] `WsEventFeeUpdate.fee_type_override` changed from `Option<String>` to `Option<FeeType>`
  (see Changed section). Downstream code matching on string values must update to match on
  `FeeType` variants.
- [Rust API] `FeeType::QuadraticWithMakerFees` is a new variant. Downstream code performing an
  exhaustive `match` on `FeeType` must handle the new variant (or rely on the existing `Unknown`
  catch-all arm).

### Version bump rationale

Pre-1.0 per VERSIONING.md: breaking Rust API changes → minor bump. The queue position field type
changes and the `FeeType` variant addition both require downstream code changes.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-29

### Compatibility

- Docs snapshot: 2026-05-29
- Validated through changelog: 2026-06-04

### Added

- [Rust API] Added `BookSide` enum (`Bid` | `Ask` | `Unknown`) to `types.rs` for the normalized
  `book_side` field added to order/fill responses on 2026-05-07.
- [Rust API] Added `outcome_side: Option<YesNo>` and `book_side: Option<BookSide>` fields to
  `Order`, `Fill`, `WsFill`, `WsFillRef`, and `WsUserOrder`. These are the normalized direction
  fields Kalshi added on 2026-05-07 (`bid` ≡ `yes`, `ask` ≡ `no`).
- [Rust API] Added `taker_outcome_side: Option<TradeTakerSide>` and `taker_book_side:
  Option<BookSide>` to the public `Trade` (REST) and `WsTrade` / `WsTradeRef` (WebSocket) objects,
  matching the normalized taker-direction fields added to trade responses on 2026-05-07.
- [Rust API] Added `balance_dollars: Option<FixedPointDollars>` to `GetBalanceResponse` for the
  centi-cent precision balance field added on 2026-05-28 (direct members only).
- [Rust API] Added `subaccount: Option<u32>` to `CreateOrderGroupResponse` for the field added on
  2026-05-07 (0 = primary, 1–32 = subaccount).
- [Rust API] Added `rfq_user_filter: Option<String>` to `GetQuotesParams` for the filter parameter
  added on 2026-05-07. Pass `"self"` to restrict to quotes on the authenticated user's RFQs.
- [Rust API] Added `WsMarketLifecycleEventType::MetadataUpdated` variant for the new lifecycle event
  type added on 2026-05-11, fired when market metadata (name, title, subtitles) changes.
- [Rust API] Surfaced the top-level `metadata_updated` payload values on `WsMarketLifecycleV2` /
  `WsMarketLifecycleV2Ref`: added `floor_strike: Option<f64>` and `yes_sub_title: Option<String>`
  (per AsyncAPI these appear at the top level only on `metadata_updated`, distinct from the
  `additional_metadata.*` copies emitted on creation), plus a top-level flatten `extra` map so other
  conditional lifecycle keys are no longer silently discarded.
- [Rust API] Added the `event_fee_update` WebSocket message: new `WsEventFeeUpdate` /
  `WsEventFeeUpdateRef` types, a `WsMsgType::EventFeeUpdate` variant, and
  `WsDataMessageV2::EventFeeUpdate` / `WsDataMessageRef::EventFeeUpdate` variants. This message is
  delivered on the existing `market_lifecycle_v2` channel and carries `event_ticker`,
  `fee_type_override`, and `fee_multiplier_override` (both overrides `null` when cleared).
  Previously these messages surfaced as `WsMessageV2::Unknown`.
- [Rust API] Added the spec-required `ts_ms` (matching-engine timestamp, ms) to `WsOrderGroupUpdate`
  and `WsOrderGroupUpdateRef`, which were previously dropping the field.
- [Rust API] Added `get_margin_fee_tiers()` method and `GetMarginFeeTiersResponse` struct for the
  `GET /margin/fee_tiers` endpoint. The response uses `maker_fee_rates` / `taker_fee_rates` (market
  ticker → decimal fee rate maps, fee = `notional * rate`).
- [Tests] Added `ws_fill_normalized_fields_parse` test covering the new `outcome_side` / `book_side`
  fields on `WsFill`.

### Changed

- [Rust API] Updated `KalshiEnvironment::demo()` and `KalshiEnvironment::production()` to use the
  dedicated external API hosts introduced on 2026-05-07. REST hosts: `external-api.demo.kalshi.co` /
  `external-api.kalshi.com`. WS hosts: `external-api-ws.demo.kalshi.co` /
  `external-api-ws.kalshi.com`. The old hosts (`demo-api.kalshi.co`, `api.elections.kalshi.com`)
  are no longer used.

### Breaking

- [Rust API] `Order.side` changed from `YesNo` to `Option<YesNo>`. The `side` field was deprecated
  by Kalshi on 2026-05-07 and removed ~2026-05-28. Downstream code must use `outcome_side` (or
  handle `None`).
- [Rust API] `Order.action` changed from `BuySell` to `Option<BuySell>`. Same deprecation/removal
  timeline as `Order.side`. Use `book_side` instead.
- [Rust API] `Fill.side` changed from `YesNo` to `Option<YesNo>` for the same reason.
- [Rust API] `Fill.action` changed from `BuySell` to `Option<BuySell>` for the same reason.
- [Rust API] `WsFill.side` changed from `YesNo` to `Option<YesNo>` for the same reason.
- [Rust API] `WsFill.action` changed from `BuySell` to `Option<BuySell>` for the same reason.
- [Rust API] `Trade.taker_side` and `WsTrade.taker_side` changed from `TradeTakerSide` to
  `Option<TradeTakerSide>`. The `taker_side` field was deprecated on 2026-05-07 in favor of
  `taker_outcome_side` / `taker_book_side`. Downstream code must handle `None`.
- [Rust API] `KalshiEnvironment::demo()` and `KalshiEnvironment::production()` now point to the new
  dedicated external API hostnames. Code that hard-coded the old host strings must update.
- [Upstream] `GET /margin/fee_tiers` response no longer returns `maker_fee_tiers` /
  `taker_fee_tiers` tier-name maps; it now returns `maker_fee_rates` / `taker_fee_rates` decimal
  maps. `GetMarginFeeTiersResponse` was added with the new shape (no old shape existed in this
  crate).


## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Compatibility

- Docs snapshot: 2026-04-18
- OpenAPI: 3.13.0
- AsyncAPI: 2.0.0
- Validated through changelog: 2026-04-16

### Added

- [Rust API] Added REST helpers for current Kalshi endpoints and aliases, including `get_market_orderbooks`, `get_trades_historical`, `get_fills_historical`, `get_live_data_by_milestone`, `get_game_stats`, and `get_market_candlesticks_historical`.
- [Rust API] Added current OpenAPI fields used by the refreshed docs, including `occurrence_datetime` on event and market payloads, `series_ticker` on historical market filters, and fixed-point quote contract fields.
- [Docs] Added `VERSIONING.md` plus repo guidance that points refresh work at the live Kalshi docs, changelog RSS, OpenAPI, and AsyncAPI documents instead of checked-in spec snapshots.

### Changed

- [Rust API] Restored `GetOrderQueuePositionsParams` to the current OpenAPI behavior by allowing unfiltered queue-position requests.
- [Rust API] Migrated the WebSocket public surface to the current V2 contract, including `WsChannelV2`, `WsMessageV2`, `WsDataMessageV2`, `WsSubscriptionParamsV2`, and the `subscribe_v2` / `unsubscribe_v2` / `update_subscription_v2` / `start_reader_v2` / `next_event_v2` methods.
- [Rust API] Aligned authenticated REST response structs with the current OpenAPI fixed-point contract for `Order`, `Trade`, `Fill`, `Settlement`, `MarketPosition`, and `EventPosition`.
- [Rust API] Aligned communications REST and WebSocket quote/RFQ payloads with the current fixed-point-only docs by removing stale integer compatibility fields and relying on `*_dollars` and `*_fp` fields.
- [Upstream] Validated the current Kalshi docs snapshot against the changelog items covering historical `series_ticker` filtering, fixed-point response cleanup, millisecond WebSocket timestamps, and `occurrence_datetime` on market responses.
- [Tests] Refreshed parsing fixtures to the current OpenAPI/AsyncAPI field sets, added coverage for `occurrence_datetime`, and added deterministic V2 WebSocket command-behavior coverage.
- [Tests] Updated live integration coverage to use the filters and account-scope assumptions required by the current communications, queue-position, and FCM-only portfolio endpoints.
- [Upstream] Updated docs, examples, and tests for Kalshi's current WebSocket handshake behavior, which now requires authenticated connections even when subscribing only to public channels.
- [Docs] Tightened the refresh workflow to remove upstream-removed schema fields and response shapes from the public Rust API instead of preserving compatibility shims by default.

### Removed

- [Docs] Removed vendored OpenAPI/AsyncAPI snapshots, spec manifest artifacts, the parity generation script, and raw spec contract tests in favor of live upstream docs plus concise `docs/spec-parity.md` notes.
- [Rust API] Removed stale REST compatibility fields and aliases that are no longer present in the current OpenAPI, including legacy fill/settlement fixed-point aliases.
- [Rust API] Removed stale WebSocket fill aliases for `yes_price_fixed` and `no_price_fixed` so parsing follows the current AsyncAPI names.
- [Rust API] Removed stale quote and RFQ integer compatibility fields from REST and WebSocket communications payloads.
- [Rust API] Removed stale WebSocket compatibility fields and shapes from `WsTicker`, `WsTrade`, `WsOrderbookSnapshot`, `WsOrderbookDelta`, and `WsFill`; downstream consumers must use the current `*_dollars` and `*_fp` fields from the live AsyncAPI contract.
- [Rust API] Removed the stale `GetMarketOrderbookResponse.orderbook` compatibility view and its synthesized integer orderbook shape; the current OpenAPI response is `orderbook_fp` only.

### Breaking

- [Rust API] Downstream WebSocket code must migrate from the pre-V2 types and methods such as `WsChannel`, `WsMessage`, `WsDataMessage`, `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `update_subscription`, `start_reader`, and `next_event` to the V2 names and `*_v2` methods.
- [Rust API] `KalshiWsClient::connect` and `KalshiWsLowLevelClient::connect` no longer provide an unauthenticated public-channel path; downstream code must use `connect_authenticated`, even for public subscriptions.
- [Rust API] V2 subscription validation is stricter: `orderbook_delta` requires `market_ticker` or `market_tickers`, rejects `market_id` and `market_ids`, and enforces exclusive market-target fields on subscribe and update commands.
- [Rust API] Downstream code must update authenticated REST response field access to the current spec names such as `fill_count_fp`, `remaining_count_fp`, `initial_count_fp`, `last_update_time`, `subaccount_number`, `total_traded_dollars`, `market_exposure_dollars`, `total_cost_dollars`, and `total_cost_shares_fp`.
- [Rust API] Legacy integer/count response fields and compatibility aliases previously accepted by `Order`, `Trade`, `Fill`, `Settlement`, `MarketPosition`, and `EventPosition` are no longer exposed by the public Rust types.
- [Rust API] Downstream WebSocket code can no longer access removed compatibility fields such as `price`, `yes_bid`, `yes_ask`, `volume`, `open_interest`, `count`, `yes_price`, `no_price`, `delta`, `no_price_dollars`, or the legacy integer orderbook snapshot levels on current V2 message types.
- [Rust API] Downstream REST code must read `GetMarketOrderbookResponse.orderbook_fp` directly; the legacy `orderbook` field has been removed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-05

### Compatibility

- Not recorded for this historical release.

### Added

- [Rust API] Added `MarketStatusConversionError` for strict lifecycle/query status conversions.
- [Rust API] Added best-effort `From` conversions between lifecycle `MarketStatus` and query `MarketStatusQuery`.
- [Rust API] Added strict `TryFrom<&...>` conversions for exact one-to-one status mapping.
- [Tests] Added and expanded parsing tests for status serialization and conversion behavior.
- [Rust API] Added `KalshiError::Parse` with parse context, human-readable reason, raw payload bytes, and optional serde source error.
- [Rust API] Added public parse accessors on `KalshiError`: `parse_context()`, `parse_error_reason()`, and `parse_raw_bytes()`.
- [Tests] Added regression tests covering REST and WebSocket parse failures to verify reason text and raw-byte preservation.

### Changed

- [Rust API] Renamed query enum `MarketStatus` to `MarketStatusQuery`.
- [Rust API] Renamed REST market lifecycle enum `MarketState` to `MarketStatus`.
- [Rust API] Updated `GetMarketsParams.status` to use `Option<MarketStatusQuery>`.
- [Rust API] Updated `Market.status` to use `Option<MarketStatus>`.
- [Docs] Updated examples, tests, and REST module docs to use the new names.
- [Rust API] REST success-response decoding now returns `KalshiError::Parse` with raw bytes instead of a plain serde JSON error.
- [Rust API] WebSocket envelope and message parsing now returns `KalshiError::Parse` with clearer parse-failure context and preserved raw payload bytes.

### Removed

- [Rust API] Removed old `MarketState` and old query `MarketStatus` names without aliases.

### Breaking

- [Rust API] Downstream consumers must update imports and enum references to the new names.
- [Rust API] Downstream exhaustive `match` statements over `KalshiError` must handle the new `Parse` variant.
